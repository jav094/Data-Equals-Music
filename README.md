# Ultrasound-Nerve-Segmentation
A prediction model that can identify nerve structures in a dataset of ultrasound images of the human neck.

### The data:
The image set is pretty large (over 1gb), so I'm not going to host it here. Instead please grab it from the original source on Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/c/ultrasound-nerve-segmentation/data

This question and data are all thanks to a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ultrasound-nerve-segmentation), thanks go to them for an inspiring problem.

### The questions:
1. What is the question you hope to answer?
Can we identify a specific nerve structure ([Brachial Plexus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachial_plexus)) in [ultrasound images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasound) of the human neck?

2. What data are you planning to use to answer that question?
Training images with the desired region of the neck manually highlighted (if present at all).

3. What do you know about the data so far?
	* The images are pretty noisy
	* Not every ultrasound image contains the Brachial Plexus

#### Why I think it's a worthwhile project:
The easy answer is: I'm studying and working in healthcare! It's a fitting topic given my field. The truer answer is: I think tech and data is the best way that I personally can help influence people's health for the better.

#### Why Kaggle thinks it's a worthwhile project:
"Even the bravest patient cringes at the mention of a surgical procedure. Surgery inevitably brings discomfort, and oftentimes involves significant post-surgical pain. Currently, patient pain is frequently managed through the use of narcotics that bring a bevy of unwanted side effects.

Accurately identifying nerve structures in ultrasound images is a critical step in effectively inserting a patientâ€™s pain management catheter... Doing so would improve catheter placement and contribute to a more pain free future."
